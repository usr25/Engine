# Engine

An attempt at making a chess engine from scratch. Under development.

### Warnings: 
    * It works, however, there is currently no support for 50-move rule


### Use

Download and extract, `$ cd Engine` and then execute `$ make all`, this will generate a binary named 'optimized'.

### About
